## Description
If you are looking for coding professionals you are in the right place. We designed a website where employers or project managers can find their team based on the Experts skills. We have created an app that allows "experts" to add their information and expertise in certain languages in order for employers to hand select the best fit for their open positions. 

## Installation

## Usage
In this app there are two different usages:

Experts;

- Add contact info for employers to contact them
- Add specific skills within a language
- Add their profeciency in that skill

Employers;

- Search experts by skill
- See all Experts who have "expert" skills
- Contact Experts through the profile card by clicking on the email given
